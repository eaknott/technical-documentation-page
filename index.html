        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
        <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser.</p>
        <p>The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.</p>
        <p>CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.</p>
        <p>A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. "Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.</p>

        <header>What you should already know</header>
        <p>To understand this guide, you should have:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Basic familiarity with using computers and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)</li>
        <li>A basic work environment set up, as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.</li>
        <li>Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS?">
        <header>What is CSS?</header>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>
        <p>In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
        <p>However, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using CSS, you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_syntax">
        <header>CSS Syntax</header>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
        <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
        <code>
          h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).</li>
          <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
          <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (red in this example).</li>
          <li>This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
        <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
        <code>
          h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 5em;
}

p {
  color: black;
}
        </code>
        <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget or when you want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_specifications">
        <header>CSS specifications</header>
        <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>
        <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.</p>
        <p>New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group — sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!</p>
        <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. Nevertheless, it is worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Adding_CSS_to_our_document">
        <header>Adding CSS to our document</header>
        <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
        <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
        <p>This link element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:</p>
        <code>
          h1 {
  color: red;
}
        </code>
        <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
        <p>You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Styling_HTML_elements">
        <header>Styling HTML elements</header>
        <p>By making our heading red, we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document, you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green, you would use:</p>
        <code>
          p {
  color: green;
}
        </code>
        <p>You can target multiple selectors at the same time by separating the selectors with a comma. If you want all paragraphs and all list items to be green, your rule would look like this:</p>
        <code>
          p,
li {
  color: green;
}
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Adding_a_class">
        <header>Adding a class</header>
        <p>So far, we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. To select a subset of the elements without changing the others, you can add a class to your HTML element and target that class in your CSS.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. </li>
          <li>In your CSS, you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:
        <code>
          .special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
        </code>
          </li>
          <li>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the <span> in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</p>
        <code>
          li.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
        </code>
        <p>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this, then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <span> or another element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</p>
        <code>
          li.special,
span.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
        </code>
        <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore, it is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Selectors">
        <header>Selectors</header>
        <p>A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. We have already discovered a variety of selectors in the Getting started with CSS tutorial. If CSS is not applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way you think it should match.</p>
        <p>Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which element or elements the rules should apply to. All the examples below are valid selectors or lists of selectors.</p>
        <code>
          h1
a:link
.manythings
#onething
*
.box p
.box p:first-child
h1, h2, .intro
        </code>
        <p>Try creating some CSS rules that use the selectors above. Add HTML to be styled by the selectors. If any of the syntax above is not familiar, try searching MDN.</p>
        <p>You may encounter scenarios where two selectors select the same HTML element. Consider the stylesheet below, with a p selector that sets paragraph text to blue. However, there is also a class that sets the text of selected elements to red.</p>
        <code>
          .special {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}
        </code>
        <p>The CSS language has rules to control which selector is stronger in the event of a conflict. These rules are called cascade and specificity. In the code block below, we define two rules for the p selector, but the paragraph text will be blue. This is because the declaration that sets the paragraph text to blue appears later in the stylesheet. Later styles replace conflicting styles that appear earlier in the stylesheet. This is the cascade rule.</p>
        <code>p {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: blue;
}</code>
        <p>However, in the case of our earlier example with the conflict between the class selector and the element selector, the class prevails, rendering the paragraph text red. How can this happen even though a conflicting style appears later in the stylesheet? A class is rated as being more specific, as in having more specificity than the element selector, so it cancels the other conflicting style declaration.</p>
        <p>Try this experiment for yourself! Add HTML, then add the two p { } rules to your stylesheet. Next, change the first p selector to .special to see how it changes the styling.</p>
        <p>The rules of specificity and the cascade can seem complicated at first. These rules are easier to understand as you become more familiar with CSS. The Cascade and inheritance section in the next module explains this in detail, including how to calculate specificity.</p>
        <p>For now, remember that specificity exists. Sometimes, CSS might not apply as you expected because something else in the stylesheet has more specificity. Recognizing that more than one rule could apply to an element is the first step in fixing these kinds of issues.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Properties_and_values">
        <header>Properties and values</header>
        <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size, width, background-color.</li>
          <li>Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are found within CSS Declaration Blocks. </p>
        <p>Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS rulesets (or CSS rules). </p>
        <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining layout and styling for a document. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page.</p>
        <p>CSS properties and values are case-insensitive. The property and value in a property-value pair are separated by a colon (:).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="@rules">
        <header>@rules</header>
        <p>CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value. For example, @import imports a stylesheet into another CSS stylesheet:</p>
        <code>
          @import "styles2.css";
        </code>
        <p>One common @rule that you are likely to encounter is @media, which is used to create media queries. Media queries use conditional logic for applying CSS styling.</p>
        <p>In the example below, the stylesheet defines a default pink background for the <body> element. However, a media query follows that defines a blue background if the browser viewport is wider than 30em.</p>
        <code>
          body {
  background-color: pink;
}

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
        </code>
        <p>You will encounter other @rules throughout these tutorials.</p>
        <p>See if you can add a media query that changes styles based on the viewport width. Change the width of your browser window to see the result.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Shorthands">
        <header>Shorthands</header>
        <p>Some properties like font, background, padding, border, and margin are called shorthand properties. This is because shorthand properties set several values in a single line.</p>
        <p>For example, this one line of code:</p>
        <code>
          /* In 4-value shorthands like padding and margin, the values are applied
   in the order top, right, bottom, left (clockwise from the top). There are also other
   shorthand types, for example 2-value shorthands, which set padding/margin
   for top/bottom, then left/right */
padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;
        </code>
        <p>is equivalent to these four lines of code:</p>
        <code>
          padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 15px;
padding-bottom: 15px;
padding-left: 5px;
        </code>
        <p>This one line:</p>
        <code>
          background: red url(bg-graphic.png) 10px 10px repeat-x fixed;
        </code>
        <p>is equivalent to these five lines:</p>
        <code>background-color: red;
background-image: url(bg-graphic.png);
background-position: 10px 10px;
background-repeat: repeat-x;
background-attachment: fixed;</code>
        <p>Try using the declarations (above) in your own CSS exercise to become more familiar with how it works. You can also experiment with different values.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>As with any coding work, it is best practice to write comments along with CSS. This helps you to remember how the code works as you come back later for fixes or enhancement. It also helps others understand the code.</p>
        <p>CSS comments begin with /* and end with */. In the example below, comments mark the start of distinct sections of code. This helps to navigate the codebase as it gets larger. With this kind of commenting in place, searching for comments in your code editor becomes a way to efficiently find a section of code.</p>
        <code>
          /* Handle basic element styling */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
body {
  font:
    1em/150% Helvetica,
    Arial,
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 33em;
}

@media (min-width: 70em) {
  /* Increase the global font size on larger screens or windows
     for better readability */
  body {
    font-size: 130%;
  }
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

/* Handle specific elements nested in the DOM */
div p,
#id:first-line {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

div p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1em;
}

div p + p {
  padding-top: 0;
}
        </code>
        <p>"Commenting out" code is also useful for temporarily disabling sections of code for testing. In the example below, the rules for .special are disabled by "commenting out" the code.</p>
        <code>/*.special {
  color: red;
}*/

p {
  color: blue;
}</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Whitespace">
        <header>Whitespace</header>
        <p>White space means actual spaces, tabs and new lines. Just as browsers ignore white space in HTML, browsers ignore white space inside CSS. The value of white space is how it can improve readability.</p>
        <p>In the example below, each declaration (and rule start/end) has its own line. This is arguably a good way to write CSS. It makes it easier to maintain and understand CSS.</p>
        <code>
          body {
  font:
    1em/150% Helvetica,
    Arial,
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 33em;
}

@media (min-width: 70em) {
  body {
    font-size: 130%;
  }
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

div p,
#id:first-line {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

div p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1em;
}

div p + p {
  padding-top: 0;
}
        </code>
        <p>The next example shows the equivalent CSS in a more compressed format. Although the two examples work the same, the one below is more difficult to read.</p>
        <code>
          body {font: 1em/150% Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; padding: 1em; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 33em;}
@media (min-width: 70em) { body { font-size: 130%;}}

h1 {font-size: 1.5em;}

div p, #id:first-line {background-color: red; border-radius: 3px;}
div p {margin: 0; padding: 1em;}
div p + p {padding-top: 0;}
        </code>
        <p>For your own projects, you will format your code according to personal preference. For team projects, you may find that a team or project has its own style guide.</p>
        <p>For example, these declarations are valid CSS:</p>
        <code>
          margin: 0 auto;
padding-left: 10px;
        </code>
        <p>But these declarations are invalid:</p>
        <code>
          margin: 0auto;
padding- left: 10px;
        </code>
        <p>Do you see the spacing errors? First, 0auto is not recognized as a valid value for the margin property. The entry 0auto is meant to be two separate values: 0 and auto. Second, the browser does not recognize padding- as a valid property. The correct property name (padding-left) is separated by an errant space.</p>
        <p>You should always make sure to separate distinct values from one another by at least one space. Keep property names and property values together as single unbroken strings.</p>
